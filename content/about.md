## Hi, I'm Peter

I'm a software engineer. I've worked at startups in the SF Bay area
for the last 5 years and now I'm a freelancer.

I look at every new project as something to learn. I started with backbonejs
and moved on to nodejs. When I returned to frontend work, I built systems with
angular and reactjs.

These days, My development tools of choice are elixir and react/redux or
turbolinks for the frontend.
